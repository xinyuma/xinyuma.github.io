## About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Operations, Information and Decisions at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is Professor [Lynn Wu](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/wulynn/). My research focuses on the economics of artificial intelligence and innovation.

Before my PhD studies, I obtained a masterâ€™s degree in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-cis/) from Penn Engineering and worked as a research analyst at the [Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu) at the Wharton School, where I conducted research on transportation policies.
